In order to run the sample, it is expected that you are familiar with npm, truffle and ganache-cli. These three items need to be installed
before running the sample application.

- Open a new terminal and run `truffle compile`
- In the same terminal run `truffle migate --network development`
- Open a terminal and run `npm install`
- In the same terminal run `npm run dev`
